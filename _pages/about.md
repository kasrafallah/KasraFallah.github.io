Hello! I’m **Kasra Fallah**, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at **Columbia University**, advised by [Professor James Anderson](https://www.columbia.edu/~ja3451/). Before Columbia, I completed my Master of Applied Science at the **University of Waterloo**, where I was supervised by [Professor Ravi Mazumdar](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~mazum/). I was awarded the Graduate Research Studentship (GRS) and the International Master's Award of Excellence (IMAE) fellow. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from **Sharif University of Technology** in Tehran, Iran, graduating with distinction. During my undergraduate studies, I served as a teaching assistant and in research positions.

Research interests
======
I am broadly interested in **stochastic analysis**, especially in its applications to **control theory**, **learning theory**, and **mathematical optimization**.

Teaching Experience
======
I have over five years of teaching experience, beginning with high school-level coaching for the **Physics Olympiad (IPhO)**, which sparked my enduring passion for teaching and mentoring. Since then, I have served as a Head Teaching Assistant (Head TA) across multiple institutions and courses:

#### Columbia University
- **EEME E6601: Introduction to Control Theory** — Head TA  
- **EEME E6602: Modern Control Theory** — Head TA  

#### University of Waterloo
- **ECE 307: Probability Theory and Statistics 2** — Head TA  

#### Sharif University of Technology
- **Probability Theory** — Head TA  
- **Mathematics for Engineering** — Head TA (2 terms)  
- **Signals and Systems** — Head TA (2 terms)
