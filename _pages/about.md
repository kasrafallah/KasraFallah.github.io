# Hello, I’m Kasra Fallah  

I am a **Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering** at **Columbia University**, advised by [Professor James Anderson](https://www.columbia.edu/~ja3451/).  

Previously, I completed my **Master of Applied Science** at the **University of Waterloo**, where I was supervised by [Professor Ravi Mazumdar](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~mazum/). I was awarded both the **Graduate Research Studentship (GRS)** and the **International Master's Award of Excellence (IMAE)**.  

I received my **Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering** from **Sharif University of Technology** in Tehran, Iran, graduating with distinction. During my undergraduate studies, I was actively involved in research and served as a teaching assistant across multiple courses.
